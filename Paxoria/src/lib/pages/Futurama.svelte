<h1>Futurama</h1>
<p>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? You don't know how to do any of those. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. How much did you make me? Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
<p>Do a flip! You know, I was God once. <strong> Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex.</strong> <em> Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</em> We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>
<h2>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</h2>
<p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
<ol>
<li>Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</li><li>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</li><li>A sexy mistake.</li>
</ol>

<h3>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</h3>
<p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</li><li>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</li><li>This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! When will that be? Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</p>
<p>No argument here. That's not soon enough! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Then we'll go with that data file! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>
<p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</p>
<p>Take me to your leader! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Is that a cooking show? Soothe us with sweet lies.</p>
<p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! A true inspiration for the children. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</p>
<p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Professor, make a woman out of me. I'll get my kit! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
<p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>
<p>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
<p>Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Anyone who laughs is a communist! What are their names? Shut up and take my money!</p>

<p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Belligerent and numerous. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
