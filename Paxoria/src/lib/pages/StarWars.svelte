<h1>Starwars</h1>
<p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! He is here. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. <strong> Ye-ha!</strong> <em> You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor!</em> Take her away!</p>
<h2>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</h2>
<p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. What?!</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</li><li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li><li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>
</ol>

<h3>What?!</h3>
<p>I'm trying not to, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
<ul>
<li>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</li><li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li><li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>I'm trying not to, kid. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don't underestimate the Force. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. As you wish. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I call it luck. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
<p>As you wish. He is here. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
<p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</p>
<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
<p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
