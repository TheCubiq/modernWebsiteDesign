<p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Ahoy hoy?</p>
<p>I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! <strong> Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</strong> <em> I'm allergic to bee stings.</em> They cause me to, uh, die.</p>
<h2>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</h2>
<p>Human contact: the final frontier. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
<ol>
<li>Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!</li><li>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</li><li>Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</h3>
<p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>

<li>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.</li><li>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</li><li>…And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</li>

<p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>
<p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
<p>That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</p>
<p>Ahoy hoy? And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
<p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!</p>
<p>Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</p>
<p>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! D'oh. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</p>
<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
<p>Thank you, steal again. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. Thank you, steal again. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</p>
