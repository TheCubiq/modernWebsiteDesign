# Cubiq's Modern website design repo

> All projects here made with Svelte

Decided ill try to recreate some behance/dribbble designs of modern websites and make them responsive, ideally ready to make them even functional. Most of these are just dummy websites to try/show off some cool 2024 design trends. You'll find there even fully featured games and all kinds of different stuff..

## Projects (released so far)

1. [Ai Assistant][l-ai-ass] \| [Repo][r-ai-ass]
2. [XOR][l-xor] \| [Repo][r-xor]
3. [Family Tree][l-tree] \| [Repo][r-tree]
4. [Scroll][l-scroll] \| [Repo][r-scroll]
5. [Emoji][l-emoji] \| [Repo][r-emoji]
6. [Tokyo Festival][l-tokyo] \| [Repo][r-tokyo]
7. [Section Preview Effect][l-threejs] \| [Repo][r-threejs]
